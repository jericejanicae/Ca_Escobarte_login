                    Even if the poverty rate gets lower, that still does not mean that our poverty, our fellow Filipinos, still do not suffer. Amidst these rising prices, these children, students, work hard in order to support their family at a young age. We want to make their education and life easier for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We support children in poverty across the Philippines by providing them the materials and help they need to succeed easier. This includes scholarships, feeding programs, and many school supply giveaways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also help fund the school uniforms of the children, and offer tutoring programs to help them catch up. We also give transportation services, as much as we can, to the students in remote places. We truly want these kids to succeed, as one of the tenets of our advocacy is to treat these kids as if they were the ones that will lead the country--because they will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We get what we give through the many investments of our founder, and donations by many kind souls across the <i>globe</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For one, the work itself is fulfilling, knowing that you get to help so many people. It's a way of giving back to the community and getting involved, and a way of showing love to your country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hands-on help, like volunteering at our organization, allows you to help more directly, and interacting with the children is so much fun. And knowing that what you're doing right now is making a big impact on their life is a feeling that can't be put into words
                </p>
                <p>
                    Donate now! Or sign up as a volunteer! Or help spread the word! Whatever suits your fancy. Just know that you're helping so many people by supporting our organization, or organizations with aims adjacent to ours.
